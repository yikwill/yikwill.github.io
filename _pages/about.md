I am a NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Scholar pursuing a Joint Major in Computer Science and Mathematics with an Emphasis in Environmental Analysis at Harvey Mudd College. My research interests lie at the intersection of climate dynamics and machine learning. I have worked on both the atmospheric and oceanographic sides of this emerging field with <a href="https://www.samjsilva.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Sam Silva</a> at the University of Southern California and <a href="https://msonnewald.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Maike Sonnewald</a> at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, respectively. I have also done research on hypothesis testing in the AMISTAD Lab with <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/" target="_blank">Prof. George Monta√±ez</a>.
