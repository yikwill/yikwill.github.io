I am a PhD student in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle where I am advised by <a href="https://www.atmos.washington.edu/~durrand/" target="_blank">Prof. Dale Durran</a>. I am also a DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellow. My research interests lie at the intersection of climate modeling and machine learning.

Previously, I earned my BS in Mathematics and Computer Science with an Emphasis in Environmental Analysis from Harvey Mudd College. As an undergraduate, I was a NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Scholar and had the opportunity to research with <a href="https://www.samjsilva.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Sam Silva</a> at the University of Southern California on neural climate model emulation, <a href="https://msonnewald.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Maike Sonnewald</a> at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory on deep learning for subsurface ocean inference, and <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~montanez/" target="_blank">Prof. George Monta√±ez</a> on hypothesis testing for fair artificial intelligence.
