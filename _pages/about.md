Hi there!
======
I'm William, a NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Scholar pursuing a Joint Major in Computer Science and Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College. My interests are in applied data science, the intersection of machine learning and climate science, and bias in artificial intelligence systems.

This summer I will be joining Dr. Maike Sonnewald at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) to explore machine learning methods to infer ocean physics in the ocean-atmosphere system.

Since the summer of 2021, I've been working as a student research in the AMISTAD (Artificial Machine Intelligence = Search Targets Awaiting Discovery) Lab of Harvey Mudd College under Prof. George Monta√±ez. My primary work involves designing open-source methods to identify bias in machine learning training data using statistical hypothesis tests, and I am currently working on developing and testing finite-sample bounds for these hypothesis tests.

I am also currently working with Prof. Sam Silva at USC to investigate deep learning for climate model emulation. Specifically, we are exploring the efficacy of randomly wired neural networks for the task using the ClimateBench dataset. Our work was recently presented at the NeurIPS 2022 workshop "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning", and we have submitted a manuscript to the AMS Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems journal.

This website is a work in progress.
