Hi there! I'm William, a NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Scholar pursuing a Joint Major in Computer Science and Mathematics with an Emphasis in Environmental Analysis at Harvey Mudd College. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and climate science. I have worked on both the atmospheric and oceanographic sides of this emerging field with Prof. Sam Silva at the University of Southern California and Prof. Maike Sonnewald at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, respectively. I have also done research on hypothesis testing in the AMISTAD Lab with Prof. George Monta√±ez.

This website is a work in progress.
